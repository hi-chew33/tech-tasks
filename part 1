Tools Used
- Command Prompt
- Notepad (encoding inspection)

Approach
The file `xotwod.txt` initially appeared to contain only song lyrics.
However, certain characters displayed inconsistently, indicating an encoding or homoglyph trick.

On closer inspection, the letter `e` in the word "there" was replaced with a Cyrillic `е`, which visually resembles the Latin character but differs in Unicode representation.

Conclusion
The repeated altered word highlighted the intended flag fragment.

Flag Fragment
part1 = there
