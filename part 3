In Part 3 of the challenge, a compressed file named qr_code_zipbomb.rar was provided.
The description suggested that the archive contained a very large number of QR codes, hinting at automation rather than manual scanning.

The objective was to extract meaningful information (the third fragment of the flag) hidden among thousands of decoy QR codes.


The archive size was small, but extraction revealed thousands of QR images.

Manually opening and scanning each QR code was impractical.

This indicated the use of a zipbomb-style noise attack, where most data is intentionally useless.

Therefore, the correct approach was to automate QR scanning using Python.

🛠 Tools & Environment

Operating System: Windows

Python Version: 3.11.8

Tools Used:

zipfile (built-in Python module)

Pillow (image handling)

pyzbar (QR decoding)

Command Prompt (CMD)

Step 1: Script Preparation

A Python script was created to:

Open the compressed archive directly

Iterate through all image files

Decode any QR code found

Print the extracted content

This avoided manual extraction and ensured safe processing of the zipbomb.


The script was executed using:

python read_qr.py


During execution:

The script scanned thousands of QR codes

Most QR codes contained decoy messages, such as:

“Keep scanning”

“Nothing useful here”

“Just a decoy”

The output intentionally flooded the terminal with noise

This behavior was expected and confirmed the challenge’s deceptive natur

Amid the decoy output, one QR code produced a unique Base64-encoded string:

PDwtLS0tcGFydDM9Z2cxb2x9LS0tLT4+


This was the only non-decoy output.



The extracted string was decoded from Base64:

<!---part3=gg1ol}--->


From this, the third fragment of the flag was identified as:

gg1ol}


Flag Fragment (Part 3):

gg1ol}


This fragment is intended to be combined with Part 1 and Part 2 from the earlier challenges to form the complete flag.
