Challenge Description

In this stage of the challenge, a single image file named heheheha.png was provided.
At first glance, the file appeared to be a normal PNG image containing logos and stickers.
Given the context of a CTF, it was assumed that the image contained hidden data using steganographic techniques.

Tools Used

Kali Linux

zsteg (LSB steganography analysis tool)

Terminal

Initial Analysis

The image was first inspected visually and showed no obvious anomalies.
Basic checks such as metadata inspection and file structure analysis did not reveal any hidden information.

The tool zsteg was chosen because it is specifically designed to detect hidden data in PNG and BMP images.

The image was analyzed using the following command:

zsteg heheheha.png


zsteg systematically checked different color channels, bit planes, and pixel traversal orders.

Key Finding

Among the outputs produced by zsteg, the following line contained readable hidden text:

b1,rgb,lsb,xy: text: "10-armykm1f3"


This indicates that:

b1: 1 bit per channel was used

rgb: Data was hidden across the Red, Green, and Blue channels

lsb: Least Significant Bit steganography was used

xy: Pixels were read in standard row-wise order

Conclusion

The readable string extracted from the image represents the second fragment of the flag.
The data was successfully hidden using LSB steganography within the RGB channels of the image.

Flag Fragment
part2 = 10-armykm1f3
