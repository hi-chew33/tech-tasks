This CTF challenge required examining an unfamiliar network service hosted on a private IP using a Kali Linux virtual machine running in VMware Workstation. During initial reconnaissance, several 
open ports were discovered on the target system at 192.168.29.111. Early interaction attempts relied on common HTTP-based tools such as curl, but most ports responded with empty replies, indicating
the service was not a typical web application. One port exposed a custom banner identifying itself as NRDP/2025.2.0.0, pointing toward a proprietary or nonstandard protocol.

Further probing with OpenSSL revealed that port 35743 supported TLS connections, and a successful TLS 1.2 handshake could be established. However, the service did not display a conventional banner 
and instead appeared to wait for direct user input. Manual commands like HELP, MENU, and FLAG produced incomplete or inconsistent outputs, suggesting that the service operated interactively. Attempts
to script or automate interaction using piped input, printf, and tools such as ncat consistently failed, resulting in timeouts or no responses. This behavior indicated that the service likely
required a genuine interactive terminal and was intentionally designed to reject non-interactive input, a common tactic in CTF challenges to prevent automation.

To overcome this limitation, the OpenSSL client was executed through rlwrap to provide proper terminal and readline support. By using the command rlwrap openssl s_client
-connect 192.168.29.111:35743 -tls1_2 -quiet, a stable interactive session was successfully established. Within this environment, issuing the FLAG command prompted a valid response from the server, 
revealing the flag and confirming successful completion of the challenge.

Other investigative approaches, such as filesystem inspection, browser-based testing, HTTP method enumeration, and analysis of mounted disk images, were deliberate distractions and yielded 
no meaningful results. This reinforced that the intended solution centered on understanding and correctly interacting with the custom protocol rather than exploiting web services or extracting 
stored data. Overall, the challenge emphasized practical skills in low-level service interaction, TLS-based socket communication, and the necessity of proper terminal handling when working
with interactive network services.
